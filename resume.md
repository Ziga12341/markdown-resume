## **PROFESSIONAL SUMMARY**

I am passionate about solving complex problems and continuously expanding my technical toolkit. I've worked with multiple languages, but Python remains my first choice. Additionally, I specialize in data processing and automation. I also bring experience in QA engineering with a focus on automated end-to-end (E2E) web testing, greatly improving product stability.

Key strengths:

‚úÖ AI-powered automation (LLM integrations, clustering, embeddings)

‚úÖ Test automation & CI/CD (Selenium, pytest, Docker, TeamCity)

‚úÖ Web & backend development (Django, FastAPI, Next.js)

‚úÖ Algorithmic problem-solving (optimizing code with recursion, memoization, and efficient data processing)
